        <p>Capitalism may be the best economic system mankind has ever devised, but just like democracy, it is only as good as people upholding it.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>There is a Native American say that there is a constant battle within us between a white and a black wolf, representing our good and bad side respectively. The one who wins is the one we feed.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>So the mess that we are in, is it a matter of finding an ever better system, or cultivate ourselves to be better people?</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>Unfortunately there is no simple answer to this, as both the people and the system are intrinsically linked and act on each other.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>Take capitalism for example. It allows the people to own the fruit of their own labour. It gives them the freedom to work harder and have more wealth. This is way better than the previous system of slavering their lives away under serfdom.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>But over time, these same hardworking people start to out produce their peers using technology, decimating entire industries and gaining massive wealth in the process, wealth that generate wealth. And we get the unsustainable growing disparity today.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>Now, are capitalism and the hardworking people good or bad? Well if you ask at the beginning, when serfdom still exists, capitalism is a savior and those people are admirable self-liberators. But when we get to late stage, capitalism is exploitative and those people becomes the oppressor in their unquenchable quest for wealth.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>What gives? The thing with capitalism or communism, is that they are defined systems, which makes them absolute. But life is not absolute, it is by definition ever changing and evolving.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>If the people do not transcend from the system they created, then the system will start act on the people to fuel itself into oblivion. Having lived in both China and the West, I can say that only two kinds of people can survive in each system in the long run.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Under communism: crooks and thugs&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Under capitalism: rats and robots&nbsp;</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>The sad thing is that most people with conscience know what is right and wrong, but are forced to behave badly because of the bad apples.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>This is basically the Game Theory&rsquo;s Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma at play. It is a situation where two accomplices who are jailed apart will both end up with a worse jail sentence, if they act logically for their own self-interest by ratting out each other. This is what our current society feels like. Everyone is looking for his own interest at the expense of the greater common good.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>Now, what if something allows the prisonners to actually communicate and hold each other accountable? They would logically reach an agreement to keep silent, and thus both receive a lesser sentence.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>And this is what TownSquare provides, communication technology to break down the barrier between people, so we can all act sustainability for the greater common good. It allows us to identify and isolate the bad apples, and encourage good behavior while punishing the bad ones.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>Of course everyone&apos;s definition of good and bad may differ, and that is the beauty of it. Unlike in a system, here we should never define how to behave, but let people decide. TownSquare simply opens the door for the possibility of like minded people to connect and bind themselves together with their own social contract. If something does not work out or fell out of favor, people can leave and join other groups. Having plurality in our society makes us adaptable to change and our progress sustainable.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>So instead of having one single overarching system that govern the entire society, we can have a multitude of mini-systems where people within each hold themselves accountable. And this is possible thanks to the intensity of interactivity provided by TownSquare.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>In the long run, the constant integration of good behaviors into our society accumulates into our social capital. Remember from the beginning, how any system is only as good as the people in it? This is how we get good people.</p>

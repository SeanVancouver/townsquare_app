        <p>Picture this. You are working hard to keep your job from being given away to someone more hardworking or cheaper. But the harder you work, the faster the AI watching you learn, and the faster you&apos;ll get replaced.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>Welcome to late stage capitalism, where there is no winning move for the losers. In a system designed to compete for capital, there is bound to have a single winner where everyone else loses.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>With all the capacities of modern technologies, we do not have a lack of resource, but a resource sharing problem. Capitalism does not permit sharing of resources unless its for profit.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>So with the wealth gap ever increasing, how can we distribute resources in a more sustainable way?</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>Of course we cannot simply take the resources from the rich, and give them to the poor. That would be communism and proven to fail.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>So are there actual cases of when resources are shared more sustainably? Of course, take the example of a tribal society. The hunter who catches game will share with the rest of the tribe, instead of keep it all for himself. Otherwise he&apos;ll be casted out of the tribe for failing to live up to his social contract. Looking closely, this is because of two specific factors:</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. The negative impact of not sharing is immediately felt as the tribe goes hungry for having nothing to eat.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. The culprit can be easily trace to the hunter.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>In today&apos;s complex world, both factors above are blurred, so there is no incentive to share.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>At the core, what is lacking is information and transparency. We have the technologies to produce and deliver wealth, but the distribution of wealth won&apos;t happen because of lack of communication and information.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>This is where TownSquare comes in, by providing the interaction necessary to bridge our fragmented social landscape into something more conducive to sharing. More information leads to more transparency for both the wealthy and the poor. This does not only pressure resource sharing, but also incentivize it.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>Imagine an economy with 10 potato farmers who are isolated enough so they cannot communicate with each other. They produce one potatoes daily, and are all connected by the common vendor who buys 10 potatoes in total. So every day, the vendor goes to one farm, buys one potato, and goes to the next until he has the 10 potato he needs to sell in the market. But one day, one farmer, let&apos;s call him Bob, invented a tool that allowed him to grow 10 potatoes a day. The vendor soon realized that he can just buy all the potatoes from Bob, and stops visiting the other nine farmers. As result, Bob became very wealthy, leaving the other farmers with no income.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>Now imagine if the farmers can communicate to each other. What will happen if everyone realized that Bob is suddenly outproducing everyone else, and thus taking their shares? There are a lot of suppositions we can make here, but undeniably, there is now pressure or incentive on Bob to share his wealth.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>With the ball in his camp, Bob being now able to interact with the others, will likely share his wealth by prioritizing those he thinks can benefit him back. For example, he could choose those who are just as hardworking, so they can produce other products. Then instead of eating potatoes all day, the whole community of farmers could now eat and sell cucumbers, corns, and prosper together.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>Again, under capitalism, there is no mechanism for the rich to share wealth to the poor, unless the poor can make rich even richer. It&apos;s in the name, the goal is to accumulate capital. Does the game of monopoly end when all players are satisfied with their financial situation? No, it ends when there is only one winner left, which is the equivalent of total societal collapse in real life.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>TownSquare is the only project that will not only save us from such scenario, but propel us to a better future, as it provide the information transparency necessary for a sustainable wealth distribution where everyone can make the best use and thrive.</p>

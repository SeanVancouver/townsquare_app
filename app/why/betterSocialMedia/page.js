        <p>The inventor of the internet, Tim Berners-Lee, once said: &quot;The Web as I envisaged it, we have not seen it yet. The future is still so much bigger than the past.&quot;</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>The same could definitely said about today&apos;s social media landscape. In fact, there is so little quality social interaction that calling platforms like Twitter or Instagram social media could be considered a misnomer.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>The reason is simple, they are made by programmers with poor grasp of social interactions. They are used to code programs to do a sequence of one task at a time, relying on the lightspeed execution of the computer to give appearance of efficiency and multitasking. Unfortunately, they assumed the same pattern to human interaction in their app design, by allowing one need to be satisfied at a time.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>Real humans cannot work at lightspeed, and usually have many needs to be satisfied at various degree. Currently, if you are simultaneously looking for a job, a relationship, and a fishing buddy using social apps, you would have to make three profiles, and devote effort on the three platforms of LinkedIn, Tinder, and Meetup. In today&apos;s fast paced world of ever shrinking attention span, this would not be a rewarding use of your time.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>The only rewarding way of using the current social media platforms is to create and consume content, where the goal is to make money and grab attention, and not to socialize.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>When people socialize in real life, they use a more natural approach. They would get to know the person first, then decide which of his needs can be satisfied from here. There is no restriction on the purpose as it is the case with online platforms. You could be talking to someone who can satisfy all your needs, by becoming your boss, your romantic partner and fishing buddy at the same time.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>And this is what TownSquare offers, by allowing users to see each other in their full humanity, and not just one facet. You can express anything you want, whether it is an article, artwork, project, etc., and get a reaction from the community. It is likely merging all the current social platforms into one, at the insignificant cost of limiting the geographical to one city, which is where most people care about when they socialize anyway.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>This works because it offers the prerequisite to mimick real and efficient human interaction. Instead of limiting the purpose of its users, TownSquare is purpose agnostic. The app is only responsible to make its users visible to others, while the users themselves determine what they want to do with the app. You can indicate, for example, that you are looking for relationship, open for employment, and want to form a rock band at the same time.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>How can someone find you based on your profile? This is where the magic happens; another user would be able to narrow down the population using their own customizable criteria. For example, someone with guitar skill between the age of 20 to 25. Then they would select your profile, and checkout the video you have uploaded shredding your guitar, and finally message you to join their band.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>The idea is to create an open world system where everyone and every post is visible. This is unprecedently empowering because you, as an individual, now have the power to interact with the community directly without prerequisite or limitation.&nbsp;</p>

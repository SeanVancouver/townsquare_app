        <p>TownSquare is an ambitious project, and it is difficult to nail a 100% working plan.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>But we could start with a general plan, and tweak/change things as we go. Here is what I propose:</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>Step 1 - Spread awareness and form a community</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; TownSquare is a new idea not known to the public, so the first step is to spread awareness to establish it in the public conscience.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; But this is easier said than done. Any movement will eventually fade out if the threshold required to accomplish the goal is not reached for long enough.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; To mitigate this time constraint, the awareness must not just be spread, but sustained.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; And this is why we must also form a community of members who support each other with friendship and fraternity. So any new member gained will not leave, and the group keeps growing as everyone struggle towards the same goal.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>Step 2 - Start a political party</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It would likely be a municipal party(or provincial/state level if needed), that can use the city&apos;s budget to accomplish the TownSquare project.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course we would have to be elected, and justify the value of TownSquare to the voters. It shouldn&apos;t be too hard if we explain it in terms of fixing wealth inequality, which is responsible for rising cost of living, homelessness, crime, unemployment, etc. Our cities spends hundreds of millions annually addressing these issues, yet TownSquare as a digital platform will cost a tiny fraction of it to run.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>Step 3 - And beyond&nbsp;</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Once the city becomes the first in the world to have its virtual twin or digital infrastructure.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The inhabitants of other cities, seeing its benefit, would want their own TownSquare too. Thankfully, it will be easier to convince and implement now, given that there is a working open source example.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; All we need is for TownSquare to be implemented in one city in the world, and it will spread like wild fire. Don&apos;t you want your city to be the one making history?</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>The movement is still in its infancy, and we need good people to join. If you&apos;d like to take part, please see here.</p>
